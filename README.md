This project focuses on solving the problem of navigation in tunnels. The field of indoor navigation is rapidly gaining momentum in the world of computing and high-tech due to the difficulty of GPS reception in such environments. Many solutions are currently being developed to enable efficient navigation using various technologies.

My project combines advanced approaches from the fields of robotics, machine learning, and remote sensing, utilizing the following technologies:

Robotics: Developing a smart robot capable of navigating independently in narrow tunnels, while avoiding obstacles and dangers.

Machine Learning: Developing algorithms for detecting mines and suspicious objects along the robot's path.

Facial Recognition: Developing a system for facial recognition through the analysis of images and video.
